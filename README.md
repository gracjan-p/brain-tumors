# Brain tumor type detection with CNN - 0.95 F1 scoring

In this project we are going to analyze 'Brain tumor dataset', T1 weighted images dataset from figshare,
apply some custom functions and Convolutional neural network model to predict brain tumor type from given images.

### This project inludes:
- Image data analysis
- Preprocessing data
- Creating neural network model
