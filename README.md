# Brain tumor type detection with CNN - 0.99 F1 scoring

In this project we are going to analyze 'Brain tumor dataset', T1 weighted images dataset from figshare,
apply some custom functions and build Convolutional neural network model to predict brain tumor type from given images.

### In this project you will find:
- Image data analysis
- Preprocessing image data
- Creating neural network model
