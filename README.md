In this project we are going to analyze 'brain tumor dataset' T1 weighted images dataset from figshare,
apply some custom functions and Convolutional neural network model that predicts brain tumor type from given image.

This project inludes:
Image data analysis
Preprocessing data
Creating neural network model
Highly reccomended to read the data-description.txt file to understand data organization.
